                <p>
                    I operate on the firm belief that the most effective technology leaders remain deeply connected to the craft of software <strong>development</strong> and the <strong>customer needs</strong> it serves. This philosophy guides my approach to leadership: I <strong>build and scale</strong> high-performing engineering <strong>teams</strong> that are empowered, innovative, and focused on delivering excellence.  With over 15 years of experience, my current focus is on spearheading the strategic implementation of <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, transforming not just <em>how</em> we create software, but what's possible for our products. My ultimate goal is to harmonize technology and talent to solve complex challenges, deliver outstanding customer value, and drive the <strong>organization toward its most ambitious strategic goals</strong>.
